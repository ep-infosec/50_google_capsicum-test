.TH CAP_RIGHTS_LIMIT 3 2014-05-21 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
cap_rights_limit \- limit Capsicum capability rights
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <sys/capsicum.h>
.sp
.BI "int cap_rights_limit(int " fd ", const cap_rights_t * " rights ");"
.SH DESCRIPTION
When a file descriptor is created by a function such as
.BR accept (2),
.BR accept4 (2),
.BR creat (2),
.BR epoll_create (2),
.BR eventfd (2),
.BR mq_open (2),
.BR open (2),
.BR openat (2),
.BR pdfork (2),
.BR pipe (2),
.BR pipe2 (2),
.BR signalfd (2),
.BR socket (2),
.BR socketpair (2)
or
.BR timerfd_create (2),
it implicitly has all Capsicum capability rights.
Those rights can be reduced (but never expanded) by using the
.BR cap_rights_limit ()
function.
Once Capsicum capability rights are reduced, operations on the file descriptor
.I fd
will be limited to those permitted by the
.I rights
argument.
.PP
The
.I rights
argument should be prepared using
.I cap_rights_init (3)
family of functions.
.PP
Capability rights assigned to a file descriptor can be obtained with the
.BR cap_rights_get (3)
function.
.PP
The complete list of the capability rights can be found in the
.BR rights (7)
manual page.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.BR cap_rights_limit ()
returns zero on success. On error, -1 is returned and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EBADF
.I fd
isn't a valid open file descriptor.
.TP
.B EINVAL
An invalid set of rights has been requested in
.IR rights .
.TP
.B ENOMEM
Out of memory.
.TP
.B ENOTCAPABLE
The arguments contain capability rights not present for the given file descriptor (Capsicum
capability rights list can only be reduced, never expanded).
.SH EXAMPLE
The following example demonstrates how to limit file descriptor capability
rights to allow reading only.
.PP
.in +4n
.nf
cap_rights_t rights;
char buf[1];
int fd;

fd = open("/tmp/foo", O_RDWR);
if (fd < 0)
    err(1, "open() failed");

if (cap_enter() < 0)
    err(1, "cap_enter() failed");

cap_rights_init(&setrights, CAP_READ);
if (cap_rights_limit(fd, &setrights) < 0)
    err(1, "cap_rights_limit() failed");

buf[0] = 'X';

if (write(fd, buf, sizeof(buf)) > 0)
    errx(1, "write() succeeded!");

if (read(fd, buf, sizeof(buf)) < 0)
    err(1, "read() failed");
.fi
